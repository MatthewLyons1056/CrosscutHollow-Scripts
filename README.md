# CrosscutHollow-Scripts
A repository to store scripts for professional use.


Howdy!

This is the entire script folder for my project "Crosscut Hollow".

There are plenty of scripts that I want to include inside this folder, however due to space I can only show a few.

The scripts inside include...

PlayerMovement.cs
-Main movement controller for the game, controls runspeed, jumps, player animations

MeleeAttaack.cs
-This script controls the players melee attack. It utulizes a raycast that checks for enemies, establishes damage values, and a cooldown for the attack.

Enemy.cs
-This script controls and references the basic functions for enemies. This includes health, loot drops, animations, death conditions and a reference to the player.
