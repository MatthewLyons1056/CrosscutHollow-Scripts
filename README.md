# CrosscutHollow-Scripts
A repository to store scripts for professional use.


Howdy!

This is a folder containing some of the scripts for my project "Crosscut Hollow".


The scripts inside include...

PlayerMovement.cs
-Main movement controller for the game, controls runspeed, jumps, player animations, refers to character controller

CharacterController2D.cs
-Controls back end movement for the player, such as grounding status, jump force, ladder refferences, wall jumping, air control, and player fliping

MeleeAttaack.cs
-This script controls the players melee attack. It utulizes a raycast that checks for enemies, establishes damage values, and a cooldown for the attack.

Enemy.cs
-This script controls and references the basic functions for enemies. This includes health, loot drops, animations, death conditions and a reference to the player.

ResourceBar.cs
-Resuable script that creates a resource that can be further referenced to UI elements. I used this script to create health/ammo for this project.
